# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?

For this project, I primarily used ChatGPT to support the development of a weather assistant built in Python.
ChatGPT played a critical role in enhancing both the backend functionality and the frontend user interface. 
I also relied on it for detailed code explanations, troubleshooting errors, and improving the structure and readability of my code.
Additionally, it helped me integrate ipywidgets to create an interactive and visually appealing interface. 
Additionally, I briefly used Perplexity to debug a specific issue related to the Geolocation and to confirm some syntax for widget styling.
While I didn’t use tools like GitHub Copilot, these two AI platforms together helped me solve problems faster and improve the overall quality of the code.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?

I used intentional prompting strategies such as breaking tasks into smaller components (“step-by-step” refinement), using before-and-after comparisons to evaluate improvements, and being specific in my requests.
For example, I would ask ChatGPT to “restructure this function for clarity” or “explain why this forecast isn’t displaying.” 
I also practiced iterative prompting, where I provided feedback based on previous AI outputs to achieve better alignment with my vision. 
This back-and-forth approach helped me become more strategic and precise in how I asked for support.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.

One aspect I’m proud of is how I transformed the code into a user-friendly app using ipywidgets. 
I successfully implemented interactive buttons with custom colors that I changed from their initial color to the colors I wanted and tooltips, which made the application not only functional but visually engaging. 
The way the application handles natural language questions and visualizes weather data as charts also stands out. 
It was rewarding to see raw weather data turned into something accessible and intuitive especially when i finally saw how my charts turned out to be.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I would focus on making the app more robust.
For instance, I would add validation for vague weather questions, implement unit tests for key functions, and explore more flexible natural language parsing.
I also would consider integrating a second API for cross-checking weather data or adding hourly forecast capabilities for more granularity.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?

This project helped me gain confidence in blending AI assistance with hands-on coding.
I’ve learned not just how to use tools like ChatGPT effectively, but also how to write better code, debug more independently, and think like a developer. 
It reinforced the value of clear prompting and showed me how AI can enhance both productivity and creativity in technical projects.
