**Repository Structure**

**1. Before-after-examples.md**

This file showcases my before-and-after AI prompting examples. It contains initial code versions, my analysis of their limitations, the follow-up prompts I provided, and the improved versions generated with AI. This demonstrates how my prompting strategy evolved to get better results.

**2. Drafts/**

A folder that includes all my initial drafts and experimentation during the coding process. These were iteratively refined with the help of AI tools before finalizing the main application logic.

**3. AI-conversations/**

This folder stores raw interactions with AI tools like ChatGPT. It provides a behind-the-scenes look at how I collaborated with AI for debugging, design decisions, and implementation tips.

**4. Prompting.md**

Outlines the prompting techniques and strategies I used. It reflects how I learned to be intentional, specific, and structured when writing prompts to get better, more helpful AI responses.

**5. Reflection.md**

This is my personal reflection on the overall project, what went well, what I would do differently, and how the use of AI impacted my learning and coding efficiency.

**Running the App in Google Colab**

**‚ùóNote:**

The "Open in Colab" button is not enabled on my GitHub.
Therefore, to run the notebook in Colab, please follow these steps below:

**Steps:**

1. Go to the desired .ipynb file (e.g., in the WeatherWiseApp folder).

2. Click Download (top right or via the file menu).

3. Go to Google Colab and open a new notebook.

4. Click on **File ‚Üí Upload notebook**, then select the file you downloaded from GitHub.
   
5. Once uploaded, you can run the cells and use the interactive interface.

**How to Use the WeatherWise Assistant**

Once the code is executed:

**Step 1**: **Ask a Weather Question*
   
In the ‚ÄúAsk‚Äù box, type: **Will it rain in Sydney tomorrow?**

Click the ‚ÄúAsk Weather‚Äù button.

The assistant will parse the question using the AI chat parser and respond with a clear weather summary (either it will rain or it will not rain)

**Step 2**: View Temperature Graph*
   
In the ‚ÄúLocation‚Äù box, type: **Sydney**

Click the ‚ÄúShow Temperature‚Äù button.

A temperature chart for Sydney over the next 5 days will appear.

**Step 3**: View Precipitation Graph*
   
While still in the ‚ÄúLocation‚Äù box (with Sydney as location still input), click: ‚ÄúShow Precipitation‚Äù button

This will display a **bar chart** showing the upcoming rainfall forecast.

**AI Tools Used**

ChatGPT: Used throughout the project for debugging, refactoring, visualisation help, and user interface design.
Perplexity: Briefly used to double-check syntax and debug styling issues like custom button colors.
