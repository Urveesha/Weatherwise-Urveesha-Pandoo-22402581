Repository Structure
1. Before-after-examples.md
This file showcases my before-and-after AI prompting examples. It contains initial code versions, my analysis of their limitations, the follow-up prompts I provided, and the improved versions generated with AI. This demonstrates how my prompting strategy evolved to get better results.

2. Drafts/
A folder that includes all my initial drafts and experimentation during the coding process. These were iteratively refined with the help of AI tools before finalizing the main application logic.

3. AI-conversations/
This folder stores raw interactions with AI tools like ChatGPT. It provides a behind-the-scenes look at how I collaborated with AI for debugging, design decisions, and implementation tips.

4. Prompting.md
Outlines the prompting techniques and strategies I used. It reflects how I learned to be intentional, specific, and structured when writing prompts to get better, more helpful AI responses.

5. Reflection.md
This is my personal reflection on the overall project, what went well, what I would do differently, and how the use of AI impacted my learning and coding efficiency.

**Running the App in Google Colab**

❗ Note: The "Open in Colab" button is not enabled on my GitHub.
To run the notebook in Colab, please follow these steps:

Go to the desired .ipynb file (e.g., in the WeatherWiseApp folder).

Click Download (top right or via the file menu).

Go to Google Colab and open a new notebook.

Click on **File → Upload notebook**, then select the file you downloaded from GitHub.

Once uploaded, you can run the cells and use the interactive interface.

**How to Use the WeatherWise Assistant**

Once the code is executed:

1. Ask a Weather Question
In the “Ask” box, type:

Will it rain in Berlin tomorrow?

Click the “Ask Weather” button.

The assistant will parse the question using the AI chat parser and respond with a clear weather summary.

2. View Temperature Graph
In the “Location” box, type:

Berlin

Click the “Show Temperature” button.

A temperature chart for Berlin over the next few days will appear.

3. View Precipitation Graph
While still in the “Location” box, click:

“Show Precipitation”

This will display a bar chart showing the upcoming rainfall forecast.

🧠 AI Tools Used
ChatGPT: Used throughout the project for debugging, refactoring, visualisation help, and user interface design.

Perplexity: Briefly used to double-check syntax and debug styling issues like custom button colors.
